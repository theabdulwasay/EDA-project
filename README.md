🎯 Problem Statement

Modern employees face significant hurdles in balancing long working hours with sleep and mental health. These challenges directly impact job satisfaction and productivity. The primary goal of this project is to analyze how these variables interact to help companies optimize work-life balance while maintaining high performance.

📊 Datasets Overview

The analysis is based on three primary data sources:



Human Resource Dataset (1,471 Rows): Includes attributes like Age, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, and Overtime.



Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health (5,000 Rows): Covers Work Location, Stress Levels, Sleep Quality, and Work-Life Balance ratings.



Remote Work Productivity Dataset (1,000 Rows): Tracks Employment Type, Productivity Scores, and Well-Being Scores.

📈 Key Visualizations

The project employs various statistical charts to uncover trends:

Univariate Analysis



Monthly Income Distribution: A histogram showing the concentration of employee earnings.



Stress Levels: A bar chart identifying the frequency of High, Medium, and Low stress among staff.

Bivariate Analysis



Job Satisfaction vs. Income: A box plot exploring if higher pay correlates with better satisfaction.



Work Hours vs. Productivity: A scatter plot comparing remote and in-office employees.

Multivariate Analysis



Correlation Heatmap: Visualizes the relationship between Age, Income, and Work-Life Balance.



Productivity & Well-Being: A complex scatter plot incorporating job type and weekly hours to see their combined effect on well-being.

💡 Conclusion



Hours vs. Performance: Longer working hours are linked to lower productivity and reduced well-being.



Remote Work: Employees in remote arrangements show slightly higher well-being scores than those in on-site roles.



Holistic Balance: Higher job satisfaction and performance are strongly associated with a healthy work-life balance.
